# Exploring Data Structures and Algorithms

CS 331 - Data Structures and Algorithms provides a comprehensive exploration of fundamental concepts in the realm of data structures and algorithms. The course is designed to equip students with a deep understanding of a wide array of data structures, including lists (both unordered and ordered), stacks, queues, expression trees, binary search trees, heaps, and hash tables. Through the lens of big-O notation, students will analyze the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity, enabling them to make informed decisions about algorithm selection and implementation.

As part of the curriculum, students will delve into intricate topics such as linked structures and references, gaining practical insights into their utilization and significance within programming contexts. The course also introduces students to core principles of object-oriented design, encompassing composition, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are essential for crafting well-structured and maintainable code. Furthermore, students will explore the trade-offs between mutable and immutable data structures, and delve into the world of recursive procedures, gaining a grasp of runtime stack mechanics. By comprehensively understanding searching and sorting algorithms and their connection to data structures, students will be well-equipped to approach real-world challenges effectively. Additionally, the course imparts practical software development techniques, including unit testing and version control, essential for creating robust and reliable software solutions. The grading structure involves machine problems, midterm exams, and a final exam, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of student performance. With a focus on foundational concepts and practical skills, CS 331 empowers students to excel in the intricate realm of data structures and algorithms.
